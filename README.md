# MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Prediction Model
Real-world time series often exhibit strong non-stationarity, complex nonlinear dynamics, and behavior expressed across multiple temporal scales, from rapid local fluctuations to
slow-evolving long-range trends. However, many contemporary architectures impose rigid, fixed-scale structural priors—such as patch-based tokenization, predefined receptive fields,
or frozen backbone encoders—which can over-regularize temporal dynamics and limit adaptability to abrupt high-magnitude events. To handle this, we introduce the Multi-scale Tem-
poral Network (MSTN), a hybrid neural architecture grounded in an Early Temporal Aggregation principle. MSTN integrates three complementary components: (i) a multi-scale
convolutional encoder that captures fine-grained local structure; (ii) a sequence modeling module that learns long-range dependencies through either recurrent or attention-based
mechanisms; and (iii) a self-gated fusion stage incorporating squeeze–excitation and a single dense layer to dynamically reweight and fuse multi-scale representations.

# Core Innovation: Dual-Path Design and Early Temporal Aggregation (ETA)

Dual-path Encoding: CNN (local) + Transformer/BiLSTM (global): parallel encoding strategy in which a global sequence-modeling pathway (Transformer or BiLSTM; CD strategy) captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a lightweight convolutional pathway (CI strategy; O(L)) extracts fine-grained local temporal patterns.

Efficiency through ETA: collapsing O(L2) to O(1). MSTN applies the ETA mechanism immediately after the high-capacity encoders, collapsing the temporal dimension (L → 1) via learned sequence aggregation. By performing the computationally intensive operations (e.g., O(L2) Transformer self-attention) before this aggregation step, the subsequent refinement layers—including feature fusion, SE recalibration, MHA, and prediction modules—operate with a fixed O(1) cost with respect to L. 

Parameter Efficiency: ~1.04M (Transformer) and ~0.40M (BiLSTM) parameters
